# AHLT - Extraction of Drug-Drug Interactions from Biomedical Texts

## SemEval 2013

The lab project consists in building a system for SemEval-2013 Task 9: Extraction of Drug-Drug Interactions from Biomedical Texts. The DDIExtraction 2013 task concerned the recognition of drugs and extraction of drug-drug interactions that appear in biomedical literature.

Two subtasks were proposed for the challenge:
1) The recognition and classification of drug names.
2) The extraction and classification of their interactions.

The `nerc` folder contains the rule-based baseline and the CRF Model to solve the Task 9.1. The `ddi` folder contains the rule-based baseline and the ML-Based Model to solve the Task 9.2. The root folder contains the Neural Network approaches for both tasks.
